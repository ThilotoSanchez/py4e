This is my workbook for Dr. Chucks Coursera specialization "Python for everybody".
Link: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python

It's a great guide for beginners because its going into detail quickly but on the other hand really pushes to participate and try things by yourself. Dr. Chuck also has this natural and easy going way of explaining complex cases. Additionally, the specialization includes not just five courses but also the link to his book with further exercises.
